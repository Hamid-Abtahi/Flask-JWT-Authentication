# JWT Login Page Project

This project is a **login page** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, which authenticates users using **JWT (JSON Web Token)**.

## Features
- User login with email and password
- JWT-based authentication for secure sessions
- Responsive design with modern HTML & CSS
- Client-side validation with JavaScript

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structuring the page
- **CSS** for styling and layout
- **JavaScript** for form handling and JWT authentication

## How It Works
1. User enters their credentials (email and password).
2. JavaScript sends the credentials to the backend API.
3. The backend verifies the credentials and returns a JWT token.
4. The token is stored in the client (e.g., localStorage) for future authenticated requests.
5. User gains access to protected resources/pages.

## Future Improvements
- Add **password reset** functionality
- Implement **token refresh** for long-term s
